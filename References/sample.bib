abstract="The birth of variational calculus and the principle of virtual work goes back to the 17th and 18th century, and the first draft of a discrete variational method with ``elementwise'' triangular shape functions was given by Leibniz (1697). First analytical studies were made by Schellbach (1851) and then, already with numerical results, by Rayleigh (1877). The mathematician Ritz (1909) marks the first discrete (direct) variational method for the linear elastic Kirchhoff plate, and the engineer Galerkin (1915) published his seminal article on FEM for linear elastic continua, postulating the orthogonality of the residua of equilibrium with respect to the test functions, but both, Ritz and Galerkin, used test and trial functions within the whole domain as supports. Courant (1943) was the first to introduce triangular and rectangular ``finite elements'' for the 2D-St.-Venant torsion problem of a prismatic bar (Poisson equ.), and Clough and his team (1956) published the first modern 2D-FEM for arrowed aircraft wings. Also Wilson, Melosh and Taylor with their important schools, e.g. Bathe and Simo, promoted in Berkeley the new discipline of ``Computational Mechanics''. Argyris (since 1959 in Stuttgart) and Zienkiewicz (since 1965 in Swansea), together with Irons e.g., developed primal FEM in a systematic way: hierarchical classes of FEs with different topologies and ansatz techniques for solid and fluid mechanics.",

abstract = {Abstract Multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) methods were introduced to solve control-volume formulations on general grids. Although these methods are general in the sense that they may be applied to any grid, their convergence and monotonicity properties vary. We introduce a new MPFA method for quadrilateral grids termed the L-method. This method seeks to minimize the number of entries in the flux stencils, while honoring uniform flow fields. The methodology is valid for general media. For homogeneous media and uniform grids in two dimensions, this method has four-point flux stencils and seven-point cell stencils, whereas the MPFA O-methods have six-point flux stencils and nine-point cell stencils. The reduced stencil of the L-method appears as a consequence of adapting the method to the closest neighboring cells, or equivalently, to the dominating principal direction of anisotropy. We have tested the convergence and monotonicity properties for this method and compared it with the O-methods. For moderate grids, the convergence rates are the same, but for rough grids with large aspect ratios, the convergence of the O-methods is lost, while the L-method converges with a reduced convergence rate. Also, the L-method has a larger monotonicity range than the O-methods. For homogeneous media and uniform parallelogram grids, the matrix of coefficients is an M-matrix whenever the method is monotone. For strongly nonmonotone cases, the oscillations observed for the O-methods are almost removed for the L-method. Instead, extrema on no-flow boundaries are observed. These undesired solutions, which only occur for parameters not common in applications, should be avoided by requiring that the previously derived monotonicity conditions are satisfied. For local grid refinements, test runs indicate that the L-method yields almost optimal solutions, and that the solution is considerably better than the solutions obtained by the O-methods. The efficiency of the linear solver is in many cases better for the L-method than for the O-methods. This is due to lower condition number and a reduced number of entries in the matrix of coefficients. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Numer Methods Partial Differential Eq 2008},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we first investigate the influence of different Dirichlet boundary discretizations on the convergence rate of the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) L-method by the numerical comparisons between the MPFA O- and L-method, and show how important it is for this new method to handle Dirichlet boundary conditions in a suitable way. A new Dirichlet boundary strategy is proposed, which in some sense can well recover the superconvergence rate of the normal velocity. In the second part of the work, the MPFA L-method with homogeneous media is studied. A systematic concept and geometrical interpretations of the L-method are given and illustrated, which yield more insight into the L-method. Finally, we apply the MPFA L-method for two-phase flow in porous media on different quadrilateral grids and compare its numerical results for the pressure and saturation with the results of the two-point flux approximation method.

abstract = {Robustness of numerical methods for multiphase flow problems in porous media is important
for development of methods to be used in a wide range of applications. Here, we discuss
monotonicity for a simplified problem of single-phase flow, but where the simulation
grids and media are allowed to be general, posing challenges to control-volume methods.
We discuss discrete formulations of the maximum principle and derive sufficient criteria
for discrete monotonicity for arbitrary nine-point control-volume discretizations
for conforming quadrilateral grids in 2D. These criteria are less restrictive than
the M-matrix property. It is shown that it is impossible to construct nine-point methods
which unconditionally satisfy the monotonicity criteria when the discretization satisfies
local conservation and exact reproduction of linear potential fields. Numerical examples
are presented which show the validity of the criteria for monotonicity. Further, the
impact of nonmonotonicity is studied. Different behavior for different discretization
methods is illuminated, and simple ideas are presented for improvement in terms of
monotonicity.},
